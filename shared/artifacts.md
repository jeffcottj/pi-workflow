# Artifacts

Everything pi-workflow produces for a project lives in one gitignored directory at
the project root. It is deliberately visible next to the code, trivially copied to
another device, and covered by a single `.gitignore` line.

```
<project-root>/.pi-workflow/

## scratch/

Diagnostic scripts a worker writes to understand something — a selector probe, a
one-off request, a print-the-shape script — go in `scratch/<pkg-id>/`, **never
inside the package's `owns` globs**.

`owns` defines what build commits. A worker debugging a scraper by writing
`inspect_dining_vm.mjs` through `inspect_dining_vm5.mjs` into an owned directory
does not just make a mess; it makes a mess that `git add` picks up, because B4
stages the package's files and those files match. Scratch under `.pi-workflow/` is
covered by the same single `.gitignore` line as everything else here, so it cannot
reach a commit no matter how the globs are written.

Delete a package's scratch directory when it completes. It is evidence while the
package is in flight and litter afterwards.

## state.json

  },

**Stage status:** `not_started` | `in_progress` | `complete`
**Decision status:** `open` | `resolved` | `moot`
**Package status:** `pending` | `running` | `review` | `complete` | `blocked` | `skipped`

## Rules

- **Atomic writes.** Write `state.json.tmp`, then rename over `state.json`. A
  killed subagent must never leave a truncated state file.
- **Idempotence.** Re-running a stage that is already `complete` never silently
  overwrites. Detect it and ask: resume, amend, or restart. On restart, archive the
  existing artifact (`plan.archived-<timestamp>/`) rather than deleting it.
- **The orchestrator owns state.json.** Subagents never write it. They return
  results; the parent records them. Two parallel workers writing state would race.
- **Never commit `.pi-workflow/`.** Every skill that touches git verifies
  `git check-ignore -q .pi-workflow` first. If it is ever found staged, that is a
  bug — stop and report rather than working around it.
- Nothing in `.pi-workflow/` is authoritative about the code. If the plan and the
  repo disagree, the repo is what exists; say so rather than editing the plan to
  match.
